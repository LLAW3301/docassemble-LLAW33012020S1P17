  # Sorry, you may *not* be eligible for the NDIS, per the requirements of section 24(1)(c) of the NDIS Act 2013 (Cth). 
  
  You may still attempt to submit an application directly to the NDIA, and take the copy of your results below as part your evidence. To check if you are eligible regardless, then you should contact the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) and make an Access Request with them. You can make this request by calling the NDIA on 1800 800 119.
