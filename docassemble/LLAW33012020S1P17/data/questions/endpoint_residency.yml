  To access the NDIS, you must be between 7 and 65 years old. 
  
  **You must also reside in Australia and be either an 
  Australian citizen or holder of a protected or special category visa.**
  
  
  *From what you've indicated, you do not meet one of these residency requirements, therefore you are unable to access the NDIS.*
  
  
  The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) makes the final decision
  about who gets to receive support under the NDIS.
